# How to contribute

You can contribute in the following ways:

- **I want to write a new chapter or subsection!**

> Wonderful!   
We want to avoid having multiple people working on the same sections or chapters or writing something which does not fit in here. 
So, first check whether there is already any issue in github that relates to the topic/chapter/subsection you want to write. 
If that is the case, comment on the issue and we will answer ASAP.   
If you cannot find any issue on github, then make a new issue and we will have a look at it.  
After we accept your proposal or wish to contribute, you can fork the project and work on your task.

- **I want to fix the grammar or some typos**

> Just make a pull request

- **I have an idea. How about a chapter about...**

> Why not! Submit a pull request and we will take that into consideration.
