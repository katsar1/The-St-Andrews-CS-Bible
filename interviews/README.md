# interviews

This folder is nothing other than a collection of interview questions.

You can contribute by adding interview questions that you have been asked at any of your interviews.

## Rules
- Verify that you have not signed an NDA 
- If you have signed an NDA and still would like to add those questions, then make sure to anonymise the problems
- Create a file called **"SCHOOL-USERNAME_year_uniyear.md"**. 
So, for example, I did a few interviews in 2013 when I was a 3rd year (BSc), then I will create a file called *"sic2_2013_3BSC.md"*
- Avoid writing any company name if possible. Rather, just write "Company 1", "Company 2", etc.
